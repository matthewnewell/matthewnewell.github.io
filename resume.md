#Media SuperCollider/OnChat

##Customer Development/Producer

##1999 – 2001 (2 years) Marina del Rey, California

Media SuperCollier created OnChat, an avatar based web community that at its peak had 1,000 new registrations per day, 100,000 members, 1,000 concurrent users and generated $30k per month in revenue. 

We started OnChat about four years before IMVU, Eric Ries's avatar based startup and often cited case study in his book, [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/). Ultimately, we learned that when bandwidth costs exceed subscription revenue, your done.

#Boss Film Studios and Digital Domain

##Visual Effects Production

##1995 – 1999 (4 years) Venice, California

Back when digital effects were not a commodity and Pixar was just a software company, Matthew worked for two of the most innovative companies in the industry. He helped produce ground breaking Computer Generated Imagery and Motion Capture for some really cool movies including True Lies, Interview with a Vampire, Apollo 13, Species, Outbreak, Starship Troopers, and Air Force One.
