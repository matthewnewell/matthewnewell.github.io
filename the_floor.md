Screenplay about about Thomas Midgley, an inventor who changed the world and almost ended it...twice! The story needs to be told, but not the guy to do it. Still, everyone should try writing a screenplay.

I also think a Cyrano do Bergerac reboot where Cyrano communicates to Christian via snap chat would be awesome. Maybe next winter.
