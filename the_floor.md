[KidPal Software](http://kidpal.weebly.com/) Our project from 2011 Indianapolis Startup Weekend. 

Abstract: We hatched kidpal over a two day period (and then the next 7 months of my life). KP collects data from all of your kids academic and extracurricular activities and puts it in one place on your phone.  

Lessons Learned: Startup Weekend exposed me to many of the remarkable folks that are part of the Indianapolis startup and software development scene. I learned that I get more enjoyment out of developing software than going to meetings with prospective investors.  When I depleted my self-funded MVP, I shifted to getting technical.  It's where I belong.

[@urbanrenewell](http://wildlifeandwatershedfriendly.weebly.com/) A blog about land, water, wine, food, family, and friends. 

Lessons Learned: Per square mile, Indiana has agruably the most altered geography in the world. There is more drainage tile per square foot here than anywhere in the world. The upside is really productive farmland and urbanization. The downside of draining a swamp, straightening the rivers, then tilling up soil and lacing it with fertilizer every year is erosion, etropophication, and dirty oceans.  I started a blog to bring awareness to this issue. Along the way I concluded change will happen with policy, not grass roots. I still feel strongly about responsible land management, but there are more productive ways to use your voice. Moving on.  MIME: clarence, you mean land use in indiana is responsible for dirty water in the Gulf of Mexico.

Winters are brutal in Indiana. I do not think its a coincidence that prozac was invented here. When winter comes, if you don't have a hobby, you're done. A few years ago, my winter hobby was to write a screenplay. Its bad. But its a great story. I also think an update of Cynero do Bergiac with the ugly guy speaking to the handsome guy via texting would be awesome. Maybe next winter.
