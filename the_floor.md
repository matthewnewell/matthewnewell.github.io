[KidPal](http://kidpal.weebly.com/) collects data from all of your kids academic and extracurricular activities and puts it on your phone.  

[Urban Renewell:](http://wildlifeandwatershedfriendly.weebly.com/) I got sick after swimming in our local reservoir and became an environmental activist.

Concluded that the solution is land use regulation, not public outreach. 

[Necessity, Invention, & Consequence](#)
Screenplay about about [Thomas Midgley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley,_Jr.), a self taught chemist and inventor who changed the world and almost ended it...twice! The story needs to be told, but not the guy to do it. Still, everyone should try writing a screenplay.

I also think a Cyrano do Bergerac reboot where Cyrano communicates to Christian via snap chat would be awesome. Maybe next winter.
