[Zero to One](http://www.foundersfund.com), by Peter Thiel

I am like the Spinal Tab of startups. When I discovered [Lean Startup], by Eric Reiss, My "Cups and Cake" was Kidpal and it's pivot into [Thank The Teacher:](thanktheteacher.html).

When I discovered the open source community, by "big bottom" was my markdown driven hithoub page, and an open source spreadsheet parsing script. I went dark on customer development and only focused on code.

So now zero to one challenges everything. Consultants are losers, monopolies are awesome, and sales is the most important thing of all. 




7 questions every

Engineering Question
 -can you creat breakthrough

Timing Question

Monopoly Question
 -big share small 

People Question

Distribution Question

Durability Question

Secret Question
 -unique opportunity others donâ€™t see
