#[Shop July Twenty Two:](http://www.shopjulytwentytwo) funky fresh things for modern day hippies

#The Problem
The artist wanted a simple interface to post product information and to process transactions. She prefers to focus on making product and expects the online portion of her business to "just work" and not cost a lot to maintain.

#The Solution
Weebly, Square, Instagram.

#Results
The artist has enough business to keep inventory close to zero. Almost too busy making stuff. She now runs a very successful hobby business.
