Thank the Teacher crowd funds fund gift carts for teachers and coaches.

In 2013, we went live in one school and raised $1900 from 30 differet donors. We awarded cards to about 100 teachers.

Here are the [results](http://teaser-thank-the-teacher.herokuapp.com/about) of our initial "Build, Measure, Learn" cycle.

If you want to use the service for a school or sports organization, please contact me.
