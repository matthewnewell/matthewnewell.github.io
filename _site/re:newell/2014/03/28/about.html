<h2>The Technical</h2>

<p>I focus on developing competencies to collect, parse, and present information. To get better, I am biased towards a very limited set of tools and processes.</p>

<p>There are other ways and probably better ways to collect, parse, and present information. But I have learned that if you explore too many alternatives, you get good at none of them. My blog has learning resources and tips that support my narrow views about systems, processes, and tools for information management. Some of these views include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Client Hardware:</em> MacBook Air. When I have to use Windows, I add Cygwin for access to UNIX and the open source universe. Windows is always slower and less elegant than Mac but can be useful when mining stovepipe data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Development:</em> My text editor is 98% Sublime and 2% vim. My shell is bash and I use git to manage change. I develop with Ruby and Rails and blog with Octopress and Markdown. I debug with pry, unit test with minitest, and make things pretty with Bootstrap.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Deployment:</em> I buy and manage domains at NameCheap, manage configurations with GitHub, and deploy with Heroku.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Lean Startup</h2>

<p>A founder needs <a href="http://usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/01/04/colts-chiefs-wild-card-playoffs-andrew-luck/4321311/">selective amnesia</a> to handle the twists, turns, rejections, and pivots. Not my strength. I prefer to focus on technical skills development and building the Minimum Viable Product. </p>

<p>I try to stick with <a href="www.theleanstartup.com">Eric Reiss&#39;s</a> lean startup prinicpals and to keep everything open and transparent. My goals are to learn, share, have fun, and to build cool things that people actually use.</p>
