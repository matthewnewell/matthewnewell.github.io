Useful Web Service is where Matthew matures software experiments into products. 

I focus on developing competencies to collect, parse, and present information. My site has some [learning resources](learn.html) to support my opinion on how best to do this. Some of these views include:

* *Client Hardware:* I prefer MacBook Air. When I have to use Windows, I add Cygwin for access to UNIX and the open source universe. 

* *Development:* My text editor is Sublime with a tiny bit of vim. My shell is bash and I use git/hub for configuration management and collaboration. I process information with Ruby and Rails, blog with Octopress, and present text with Markdown as much as possible. I debug with pry and make things pretty with Bootstrap. I tinker with test driven development (TDD) and JavaScript and am infatuated with d3.js.

* *Deployment:* I manage domains at NameCheap and deploy with Heroku.

#Projects
A founder needs selective amnesia to handle the twists, turns, rejections, and pivots. And while I do enjoy a good roller coaster ride, the journey can take away from the developing the things that create value in the first place.

I prefer to focus on developing technical skills so that I can bootstrap my projects. 

My goals are to learn, share, have fun and build cool things that people find useful. You may view a copy of my resume [here](/resume.html).
