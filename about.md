>Our mission is to commoditize the barriers to entry to federal opportunity that have stiffled open competition.

We compete by applying commercial best practice in lean startup, collaborative open source software development, and cloud service to the federal business space. 

Increased competition in federal procurement benefits the tax payer, federal government, and the warfighter. 

###Areas of Expertise
We focus on developing competencies to collect, parse, and present information.
