I focus on developing competencies to collect, parse, and present information. There are many ways to do this. Explore too many options and get good at none of them. 
 
My site has links to [learning resources](learn.html) to support my approach to information collection, parse, and presentation. Some of these views include:

1. *Client Hardware:* I prefer MacBook Air. When I have to use Windows, I add Cygwin for access to UNIX and the open source universe. 

2. *Development:* My text editor is 98% Sublime and 2% vim. My shell is bash and I use git(hub) for configuration management. I process information with Ruby and Rails, blog with Octopress, and present text with Markdown as much as possible. I debug with pry and make things pretty with Bootstrap. I aspire to become competent test driven development (TDD) and JavaScript, in particular d3.js.

3. *Deployment:* I manage domains at NameCheap and deploy with Heroku.

##Experiments
A founder needs [selective amnesia](http://usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/01/04/colts-chiefs-wild-card-playoffs-andrew-luck/4321311/) to handle the twists, turns, rejections, and pivots. And while I do enjoy a good roller coaster ride, the journey can take away from the things that create value in the first place. 

My experiments are [MVPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) modeled after ideas described in Eric Reiss' book [The Lean Startup](theleanstartup.com) with one egregious exception: I am very light on customer development. For me, understanding "what to build" takes a back seat to learning "how to build". This is because I am not interested maturing an idea with someone elses' money. And because roller coaster rides are taxing.

I prefer to focus on developing technical skills to bootstrap my experiments. My goals are to learn, share, have fun, and build cool things that people may find useful.
