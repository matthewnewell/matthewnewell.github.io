Useful Web Service is where [Matt](resume.html) matures software experiments into products. His projects sometimes have revenue objectives. At this time learning software develelopment technique and cloud service deployment options take priority over revenue generation.

We focus on developing competencies to collect, parse, and present information. Our site has some [learning resources](learn.html) to support our opinion on how best to do this. Some of these views include:

* *Client Hardware:* I prefer MacBook Air. When I have to use Windows, I add Cygwin for access to UNIX and the open source universe. 

* *Development:* My text editor is Sublime with a tiny bit of vim. My shell is bash and I use git/hub for configuration management and collaboration. I process information with Ruby and Rails, blog with Octopress, and present text with Markdown as much as possible. I debug with pry and make things pretty with Bootstrap. I tinker with test driven development (TDD) and JavaScript and am infatuated by d3.js.

* *Deployment:* I manage domains at NameCheap and deploy with Heroku.

#Projects
A founder needs selective amnesia to handle the twists, turns, rejections, and pivots. And while I do enjoy a good roller coaster ride, the journey can take away from developing the things that create value in the first place.

I prefer to focus on developing technical skills so that I can bootstrap my projects. I enjoy the customer discovery process but my key predecessor is learning software and cloud deployment options. This is the best way to serve my customers. Listen, learn, apply.

My goals are to learn, share, and to have fun building useful things with interesting people. You may view a copy of my resume [here](/resume.html).
