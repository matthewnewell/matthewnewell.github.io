>You never change things by fighting the existing reality. <br>
To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.<br>
-R. Buckminister Fuller

Our mission is to lower barriers to enter and compete in the federal business space.

Competitive federal procurement benefits the taxpayer, our federal government, and our warfighters. 

We apply common commercial concepts, products, and services such as lean startup, open source software development, and cloud migration services to the federal business space. 

We value transparency, collaboration, and invention. <br>We value people that create things that produce value.
