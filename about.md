Useful Web Service is where Matthew matures software experiments into products. 

I focus on developing competencies to collect, parse, and present information. My site has some [learning resources](learn.html) to support my take on how to do this. Some of these views include:

1. *Client Hardware:* I prefer MacBook Air. When I have to use Windows, I add Cygwin for access to UNIX and the open source universe. 

2. *Development:* My text editor is Sublime with a tiny bit of vim. My shell is bash and I use git/hub/ for configuration management. I process information with Ruby and Rails, blog with Octopress, and present text with Markdown as much as possible. I debug with pry and make things pretty with Bootstrap. I tinker with test driven development (TDD) and JavaScript and am infatuated with d3.js.

3. *Deployment:* I manage domains at NameCheap and deploy with Heroku.

#Projects
A founder needs [selective amnesia](http://usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/01/04/colts-chiefs-wild-card-playoffs-andrew-luck/4321311/) to handle the twists, turns, rejections, and pivots. And while I do enjoy a good roller coaster ride, the journey can take away from the things that create value in the first place. -replace with luck image goaline, link to article, tag: Luck leads team back from 35 point deficit-

I prefer to focus on developing technical skills so that I can bootstrap my projects. My goals are to learn, share, have fun, and build cool things that people may find useful.
