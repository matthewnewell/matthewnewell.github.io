#[The Basketball Hacker](https://github.com/matthewnewell/basketball_hacker) 

[https://github.com.matthewnewell/basketball_hacker](https://github.com/matthewnewell/basketball_hacker) 

The objective of Basketball Hacker is to teach kids how to write software through a series of basketball themed programming exercises.  
As the student athlete completes course modules, he/she earns credits that can be used to buy team apparel, sports equipment, subsidized team dues, and private instruction sessions (for software or basketball).
