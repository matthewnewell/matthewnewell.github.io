Software training for kids just in case they don't go pro.  

Basketball Hacker is a set of ruby exercises with basketball releated themes. Your fist challenge is to write a shot clock. Then a scoreboard. Pretty soon you will be making team objects and player objects.  

Along the way, your baller learns the fundamentals of object orienterd programming, the ruby programming language and test driven development.
