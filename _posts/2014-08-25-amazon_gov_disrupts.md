##Summary

* In August 2014, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DSIA) issued Amazon Web Service (AWS) GovCloud provisional authorization under the DOD Cloud Security Model at a 1-5 security impact level. 
* The new authorization enables GovCloud and the DOD to move forward with application deployments processing controlled and FOUO unclassified information.
* Government contractors embracing AWS GovCloud will enjoy significant competitive advantage on cost, technical, and information assurance compliance requirements.

##Background

* AWS GovCloud is an isolated region dedicated entirely to U.S. government customers through a private connection routed to DOD’s network.

* GovCloud is designed to meet US Government International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and includes many additional requirements on top of what is required by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).

##Case Study

NASA recently migrated 110 websites and applications to the AWS and AWS GovCloud including NASA.gov and their internal NASA Engineering Network, which holds 3 million engineering documents. 

The new environment generated immediate cost savings of 40%. The platform is expected to reduce agency’s monthly operations and maintenance costs by around 25%, according to Roopangi Kadakia, NASA’s Chief Information Officer.

##Opportunities

For the first time ever, government contractors serving the Depart of Defense have a cloud infrastructure equal to that of commercial industry.  Companies that embrace GovCloud will become significantly more competitive on technical solution, information assurance compliance, and operations and maintenance.

##AWS GovCloud Application Use Cases

* Enterprise Applications

* High Performance Computing (HPC) and Analytics

* Storage and Disaster Recovery

* Web Applications
