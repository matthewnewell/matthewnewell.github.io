title: AWS Gov Disrupts Everything Federal

Our government requires data to be secure. So secure in fact that it can be extremely expensive to establish and maintain a secure data environment. Few companies can afford to operate in this space and their services are almost always inferior to commercial cloud services.  

Federal information assurance compliance almost always means products built for our government, including the communication services for the department of defense,  be more expensive and less sophisticated than commercial.

Its so important to keep bad people out that we keep innovation from getting in.   

In August 2014, Amazon Web Services became certified to process Fed 1 to x.  

Federal contracts thrive on inertia. The incumbent always has an advantage. However, the disruptive impact of A Cloud will be huge.  The comoditazation of web services and information assurance levels the playing field.

Just like in commercial, agile startups can now compete with the bigs for government contracts. 

-A one person system engineering consultant can render simulations on the cloud.
-Information exchange repositories will be as slick as dropbox
-MVPs will pop up quickly

Startups still lack the overhead to support complex contracting and and reporting requirements. And even though earned value is a farce, its not going away.  This favors the bigs. 

Of course, established contracts will be able to take advantage of Gov cloud. NASA did just that and saw costs drop by 40%.

The paradox of government contracting is that if you could cut your costs by 80%, would you? 

Who’s gonna win? I’m going to bet on the hybrid. A person with one foot in defense and one foot in the open source met averse.
