Geist Reservoir has an aquatic vegetation problem. Our shorelines and marinas and boating channels are clogged with weeds and mud has filled in many of the shallow areas. As a result, our Reservoir recreation options are becomming increasingly limited.

We have a vegetation problem because our Reservoir is full of nutrients. Most of these nutrients come from the mud (called sediment) at the bottom of the Reservoir. Sediment comes from soil erosion.  Soil erosion is the result of a complex calculation involving **rain patterns**, **soil conditions**, and **land management practices**.

The only way to make lasting improvements to Geist Resevoir is by changing the way we take care of our land. Here’s why:

When it rains in Central Indiana, it pours.  And when it pours on our mostly clay soils, water pools and then overflows into our storm drains, retention ponds, rivers, streams, and Reservoir. Along the way, surface water picks up tiny pieces of dirt that eventually become sediment.  This is why we have “mud” in Mud Creek. 

Up until a few years ago, Geist Reservoir had an algae problem. This happened because 1) algae is very good at consuming nutrients from soil erosion and 2) nothing in the Reservoir is very good at consuming algae. Algae blooms limited sunlight from entering the water which in turn restricted aquatic plant growth. Then [zebra mussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_mussel) happened.

Zebra mussels are a freakishly competitive species of exotic mussel that filter feed on algae.  They are so good at eating algae that since their introduction to Geist Reservoir a few years ago, water visibility has gone from almost zero to several feet. No more algae blooms. 

Aquatic plants, like algae, need light and nutrients to survive. Thanks to the zebras, light now penetrates down to the nutrient rich mud at the bottom our Reservoir. The algae population is kept in check by zebra mussels. And the aquatic plants are finally getting their day in the sun.

We humans also like a day in the sun. To make this possible, we spray the Reservoir with aquatic herbicides. This is a fairly cheap way to keep the Reservoir usable for a season. It is maybe not a great long term solution. 

Dredging might be part of a long term solution. But without changes to our land management practices, soil erosion will fill in dredged areas after a few years. Think sand castle vs. rising tide. Tide always wins.

So, here is how we can fix our Reservoir:

**Step 1: Vote**

Soil erosion rates are the result of zoning laws that dictate land management practices. Expect no significant change soil erosion rates unless our elected officials upgrade zoning laws and enforce better land management practices.  Do you think it is possible to grow our economy *and* have environmentally responsible zoning that protects our Reservoir?  Please keep this in mind next time you vote.

**Step 2: Plant more plants**

Central Indiana soil is mostly clay. Plants break up clay. Plant roots make channels in soil and improve water infiltration. Herbacious plant parts decompose and transform clay into hummus. Over time, plants make clay porous and fertile. Rainwater absorption rates improve. Less runoff means less soil erosion. Less soil erosion means less food for aquatic plants in our Reservoir. 

The best plants to plant are the ones with really deep roots. Trees and shrubs are great. So are ornamental grasses and perennial flowers. And then there’s your lawn.

Central Indiana lawns are often composed of species of grass with very short roots. Short root lawns require frequent light irrigation to stay healthy. They cannot hold much water during a heavy rain. 

Please consider over-seeding your lawn with drought tolerant grass seed.  These are newer cultivars of rye and fescue that have a nice thin blade like bluegrass but put down a very deep root. They require significantly less water and fertilizer to stay green. As the lawn matures, grass roots will break up clay soil which in turn will reduce runoff and slow soil erosion. 

Drought tolerant seed blends are available everywhere from Costco and Home Depot to garden centers and specialty shops like Advanced Turf Solutions in Noblesville. Some of the more popular brands are [Pennington Smart Seed](http://www.penningtonseed.com/products/smart-seed), [Scotts tall fescue blends](http://www.scotts.com/smg/gocat/turf-builder-grass-seeds/cat50050), and [Perals Premium](http://www.pearlspremium.com/). Perals claims a 12" root, once a month mowing, and once a year fertilizer. You can get it at Costco. 

The best time to over-seed a lawn is right now. You should do it.
   
**Step 3: Get involved**

It takes a village to fix a Reservoir.  That's where the [Geist Lake Coalition](http://geistlake.com/) comes in.  The GLC works with the Department of Natural Resources and the City of Fishers to find ways to maximize the recreational and aesthetic value of our Reservoir. 

The GLC needs forward thinking leaders in government, retail, utilities, real estate, watersport recreation, education and the landscape industry. They need farmers and homeowners and entrepreneurs. We need people that want to help develop meaningful corrective actions that are economically viable and have long term benefits.

Thank you for being part of the solution. The consequences of inaction are too high for our home values, our environment, and our economy.
