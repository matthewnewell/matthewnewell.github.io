Geist Reservoir has an aquatic vegetation problem.

We have a vegetation problem because our Reservoir is full of nutrients. Most of these nutrients come from mud (called sediment) at the bottom of the Reservoir. Sediment comes from soil erosion.  Soil erosion is the output of a complex calculation involving rain patterns, soil conditions, and land management practices.

We cannot change rain patterns. We cannot change soil (we can improve it). The only variable we control in the Reservoir equation is land management. 

In other words, we cannot fix our Reservoir until we take better care our soil. Here’s why:

When it rains in Central Indiana, it pours.  And when it pours on our mostly clay soils, water pools on the surface. If it rains hard enough, pools of surface water overflow into storm drains, retention ponds, rivers, streams, and Reservoir. Along the way, surface water picks up tiny pieces of dirt that eventually become sediment.  This is what puts the “mud” in Mud Creek. 

Up until a few years ago, Geist Reservoir had an algae problem. This happened because 1) algae is very good at consuming nutrients from soil erosion and 2) nothing in the Reservoir is very good at consuming algae. Algae blooms limited sunlight from entering the water which in turn restricted aquatic plant growth. Then [zebra mussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_mussel) happened.

Zebra mussels are a freakishly competitive super species of exotic mussel that filter feed on algae.  They are so good at eating algae that since their introduction to Geist Reservoir a few years ago, water visibility has gone from almost zero to several feet. No more algae blooms. 

Aquatic plants, like algae, need light and nutrients to survive. Thanks to the zebras, light now penetrates down to the nutrient rich mud at the bottom our Reservoir. Our algae population is kept in check by zebra mussels. And the aquatic plants are finally getting their day in the sun.

We humans also like a day in the sun. To make this possible, we spray the Reservoir with aquatic herbicides. This is a fairly cheap way to keep the Reservoir usable for a season. It is not a long term solution.  

Dredging could be part of a long term solution. But without changes to our land management practices, soil erosion will fill in dredged areas. Think sand castle vs. rising tide. The tide always wins.

So, here is how we can fix our Reservoir:

**Step 1: Vote**

Soil erosion rates are the result of zoning laws that dictate land management practices. There will be no significant change in soil erosion rates until our elected officials upgrade our zoning laws.  Do you think it is possible to sustain our vibrant economy *and* have environmentally responsible zoning?  Please keep this in mind next time you vote.

**Step 2: Plant more plants**

Central Indiana soil is mostly clay. Plants break up clay. Plant roots make channels in soil and improve water infiltration. Dead plant parts decompose and transform clay into hummus. Over time, plants make clay porous and fertile.  Check out a forest if you don’t believe me. Plants work wonders.

The best plants to plant are the ones with really deep roots. Trees and shrubs are great. So are ornamental grasses and perennial flowers. And then there’s your lawn.

Most lawns in Central Indiana use species of grass with very short roots. Short root lawns get thirsty quickly but cannot hold a significant amount of water. Add a few seasons of lawnmower compaction and diligent applications of weed killer (dandelion: big taproot), and you get a lawn with an absorption capacity roughly equivalent to concrete.

If you own land and want to help the Reservoir and save a bit of money, over-seed  your lawn with drought tolerant grass seed.  Drought tolerant seed are newer cultivars of rye and fescue that have a nice thin blade like bluegrass but put down a much deeper root. They require significantly less water and fertilizer to stay green. They break up clay soil which in turn reduces runoff and slows down soil erosion. 

Drought tolerant seed blends are available everywhere from Costco and Home Depot to garden centers and specialty shops like Advanced Turf Solutions. Some of the more popular brands are [Pennington Smart Seed](http://www.penningtonseed.com/products/smart-seed), [Scotts tall fescue blends](http://www.scotts.com/smg/gocat/turf-builder-grass-seeds/cat50050), and [Perals Premium](http://www.pearlspremium.com/). Perals claims a 12" root!

The best time to over-seed a lawn is right now. You should do it.
   
**Step 3: Get involved**

It takes a village to fix a Reservoir.  That's where the [Geist Lake Coalition](http://geistlake.com/) comes in.  The GLC works with the Department of Natural Resources and the City of Fishers to figure out ways to maximize the recreational and aesthetic value of our Reservoir. 

The GLC needs forward thinking leaders in government, retail, utilities, real estate, watersport recreation, education and the landscape industry. They need farmers and homeowners and entrepreneurs. Together, we can develop meaningful corrective actions that are economically viable and have long term benefits.

Its going to get ugly and at times disruptive. But together, its going to get done. The consequences of inaction are too high for our home values, our environment, and our economy.
