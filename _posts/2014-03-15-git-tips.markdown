Git Tipsheet
------------
1. git add --all #this will respect deleted files. better than git add .
2. git commit -m "Fixes #1. OBE been_there global with use of raise. ". This will auto close github issue tracker Number 1. Commit message must include "Fixes #1".
3. git branch branchname -d #this will delete branches that are no longer useful. do this after a successful merge to master branch.
4. git mergetool  #run this after a git merge branchname when there are merge conflicts
5. git branch -v  #view last commit for each branch
6. git branch --merged  #show which branches are merged to current branch. Merged branches can usually be deleted.
7. git branch --no-merged #have not yet been merged. Attempt to delete will fail
Git Branching Remote Branches: for multi-user collaborations with a remote origin
1. git fetch origin  #this synchronizes work between your git clone and most current merges to master on origin
