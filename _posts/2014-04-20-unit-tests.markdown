Got [this article](http://programming.oreilly.com/2014/04/ruby-the-unit-test-friendly-language.html?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email) from [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/). 

I parse large datasets on a fairly slow computer emulating Linux via [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/). This not an ideal engineering environment but it is acceptible to current employer and actually a pretty nice way to integrate with a Windows workplace.

Anyway, I know tests are good for me, but have not written any for my projects. This article may change that. Singleton method to small example datasets.
